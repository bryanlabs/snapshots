```

*Note: Actual speeds depend on number of concurrent users*

### Download Management

wget -c https://snapshots.bryanlabs.net/download/cosmos/latest.tar.lz4
```

```

## Usage Best Practices

### Optimize Download Speed

#### 1. Use Multi-Connection Downloads
```bash
# aria2 with optimized settings for premium
aria2c -x 8 -s 8 -k 1M --file-allocation=none \
  --max-connection-per-server=8 \
  --min-split-size=1M \
  "https://snapshots.bryanlabs.net/download/cosmos/latest.tar.lz4"
```

#### 2. Schedule Large Downloads
- Download during off-peak hours for best speeds
- Use our API to check current bandwidth usage
- Set up automated downloads during quiet periods

#### 3. Geographic Considerations
- Our CDN automatically routes to nearest server
- Premium tier gets priority routing
- Contact support for region-specific optimizations

### Automation Examples

#### Daily Snapshot Sync
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# daily-sync.sh - Run via cron

CHAINS=("cosmos" "osmosis" "juno")
DOWNLOAD_DIR="/data/snapshots"

# Login once
AUTH_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://snapshots.bryanlabs.net/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"'$EMAIL'", "password":"'$PASSWORD'"}' \
  | jq -r .token)

for chain in "${CHAINS[@]}"; do
  echo "Downloading $chain snapshot..."
  
  # Get latest snapshot info
  SNAPSHOT_INFO=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
    https://snapshots.bryanlabs.net/api/v1/chains/$chain/snapshots \
    | jq -r '.data[0]')
  
  # Download if newer than local
  # ... download logic here
done
```

#### Health Check Integration
```python
# snapshot_monitor.py
import requests
import time

class SnapshotMonitor:
    def __init__(self, email, password):
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.login(email, password)
    
    def login(self, email, password):
        response = self.session.post(
            'https://snapshots.bryanlabs.net/api/v1/auth/login',
            json={'email': email, 'password': password}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
    
    def check_snapshot_age(self, chain_id, max_age_hours=25):
        response = self.session.get(
            f'https://snapshots.bryanlabs.net/api/v1/chains/{chain_id}/snapshots'
        )
        latest = response.json()['data'][0]
        
        age = time.time() - latest['createdAt']
        if age > max_age_hours * 3600:
            self.alert(f"Snapshot for {chain_id} is {age/3600:.1f} hours old!")
```
